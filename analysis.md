# Wallet Credit Score Analysis

This analysis summarizes the results from processing 100,000 DeFi transactions from the Aave V2 protocol, and assigning a credit score (0‚Äì1000) to each wallet based on behavior patterns.

## üî¢ Score Distribution

| Score Range | Number of Wallets |
|-------------|-------------------|
| 0‚Äì100       | 0                 |
| 100‚Äì200     | 0                 |
| 200‚Äì300     | 0                 |
| 300‚Äì400     | ~20               |
| 400‚Äì500     | ~1700             |
| 500‚Äì600     | ~650              |
| 600‚Äì700     | ~220              |
| 700‚Äì800     | ~540              |
| 800‚Äì900     | ~300              |
| 900‚Äì1000    | ~100              |

## üß† Behavior Analysis

### üü† Low-Scoring Wallets (400‚Äì500)
- Typically made 1‚Äì2 deposits or transactions
- Borrowed nothing or repaid nothing
- Little time activity (`activity_span_days` = 0‚Äì7)
- May represent one-time users, test wallets, or bots

### üü° Mid-Scoring Wallets (600‚Äì700)
- Moderate borrow/repay behavior
- Reasonable `repay_to_borrow_ratio` (> 0.5)
- Diverse token interactions (3+ tokens)
- Active for 1‚Äì3 months

### üü¢ High-Scoring Wallets (800+)
- Consistent interaction with protocol
- Repaid a large share of borrowed funds
- Good `deposit_to_borrow_ratio` (> 2.0)
- Interacted over a long duration (100+ days)
- Used 5+ unique tokens

---

## üìä Observations

- Majority of users are either casual or passive participants
- Few power users show truly responsible behavior
- Scoring logic is sensitive to repayment behavior and duration of engagement
- Can be extended to reward liquidity providers or governance voters

---

## üîÅ Next Steps

- Add clustering to detect user types
- Analyze wallets involved in liquidation
- Extend features to cover profit/loss (PnL), flash loans, or arbitrage

## üö® Limitations and Model Behavior

Although our credit scoring model is **not a machine learning model**, it's important to understand its behavior in terms of modeling capacity and fairness.

### ‚ùå No Overfitting or Underfitting

Since our model is **rule-based**, it does not "learn" from data. Therefore:

- It cannot **overfit** (there‚Äôs no training process or risk of memorizing noise)
- It cannot **underfit** in the traditional sense
- It has **zero variance** (it produces the same output given the same input)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è However, It Can Still Have Bias

Our model uses fixed rules and manually assigned weights. This means:

- It may unintentionally **favor certain behaviors** (e.g., only high depositors)
- It might **penalize legitimate users** who behave differently from the "ideal" profile
- It lacks adaptability to evolving behaviors, bots, or new strategies in DeFi

#### üß† Example of Implicit Bias:

- A wallet that **only deposits large amounts** and never borrows might receive a **moderate score**
- A wallet that **borrows and repays small amounts repeatedly** might score **higher**, even if total volume is lower
- A wallet that **redeems frequently or uses diverse tokens** might be rewarded, even if behavior is riskier

## üîÆ Future Improvements

To improve fairness, robustness, and adaptability, the system could be upgraded with:

- ‚úÖ **Unsupervised learning** (e.g., clustering wallet behaviors with K-means or DBSCAN)
- ‚úÖ **Supervised ML models** (e.g., gradient boosting, logistic regression) trained on labeled wallet reputations
- ‚úÖ **Time-series modeling** for understanding behavior trends over time
- ‚úÖ **Anomaly detection** for identifying bots, flash loans, and exploitative patterns
- ‚úÖ **Explainability tools** to provide transparency into ML-based scores

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Until then, this rule-based system offers a transparent and interpretable baseline for assessing DeFi wallet behavior.
